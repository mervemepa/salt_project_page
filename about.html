            <p>This project focuses on pluralistically revitalizing
            the complex interactions and intersections between human, technology, and environment by using the
            concepts of 'thread' and 'trace' as metaphors. It is based on transforming the archaeology of weaving and
            computer technologies and the cartography of the environments they create into a narrative form. For about three years,
            I have been studying on the history and cultural memory impacts of handcraft
            practices, particularly weaving, as well as networks and the effects of contemporary hardware and
            software technologies. As a convergence point of the research I have conducted during this process, I
            pla ce 'thread' at the center of this study. This is because the concept of 'thread' encompasses many
            meanings related to the recording of environment, technology, and memory. In its broadest usage, a
            thread is a kind of filament suspended among points in th ree dimensional space or entwined with other
            threads. This material has been used for centuries in various handcraft practices such as knitting,
            knotting, weaving, and stitching to record social memory. However, at the same time, 'thread' in
            computing refe rs to the smallest unit of execution of a program. Each thread shares its memory space
            with the relevant process. And all computing technologies and machines are operated within
            environments created by software and the networks between them. Not surprising ly, the term 'thread'
            can also metaphorically be used to denote interconnected parts of something, like thoughts or a
            conversation, as if they were threaded together. When threads embody , they transform into traces and,
            furthermore, surfaces, i.e., environments. In short, they produce interconnectivity, generating
            environments: texts or records storing memory, underground or overground infrastructures, internet
            networks, etc.The environments created by the threads encountered in every aspect of life encompass us. However,
            this is not a place with defined boundaries; it's an environment where various connections are completely
            intertwined. Within this intermingling zone this ne twork of interwoven lines there is no inside or
            outside, only span s and passages. However, throughout history, imperial powers have attempted to
            invade the settled world by creating networks of connections on the earth's surface. On the contrary,
            t hese con nections are essentially lines of occupation. They are often straight and orderly, intersecting
            only at power nodes. As they traverse the terrain, they tend to cut through established lines of settlement,
            such as highways, railways, property boundaries or, protocols . But occupation lines not only establish
            connections; they also divide the occupied area into regional blocs. This fragmentation has also occurred
            in related fields such as access, travel, where journeys have been replaced by destination orient ed
            transportation, cartography where sketches have been replaced by route planning, and textuality where
            storytelling has been replaced by preconceived narrative structures. It has also transformed our
            understanding of place: once a mesh of multiple and intertwined movements, minds, and threads, a place
            is now seen as a node in a static network of connections. Therefore, I plan to structure this project as a multi-layered
            storytelling on an environment that reverses
            this understanding: a narrative fabric consisting of non-linear narratives and a porous environment
            created by the threads and traces they leave behind. In doing so, I intend to trace both material or seen
            threads—such as the historical transformation of thread—and immaterial or unseen threads—like
            internet networks, textuality, and communication—and the traces they create—earthly traces, mental
            and archaeological traces. Here, I envision each element of the story as a moment of ongoing activity.
            That is to say, all subjects of the project will be characterized by their relations with what they produce,
            what is currently alongside them, and what follows them in the world, at the point where action and
            reaction converge. Here, the meaning of 'relation' should be understood not as a connection between
            pre-positioned entities but as a path traced in the landscape of lived experience. It's not so much a
            convergence of points in a network as it is a network of interwoven traces.</p>
